# Browser and clipboard actions

```ts
import { openExternalUrl, writeClipboardText } from "@solo/solid"

try {
  openExternalUrl("https://example.com/article")
  writeClipboardText("https://example.com/article")
} catch (error) {
  // Show a failure message in your app.
  console.error(error)
}
```

Both functions are synchronous, return `void`, and throw catchable errors.
They are independent of a mounted renderer or Solid owner, so they work in
button callbacks, application commands, and startup code. Currently they support
macOS on the main JavaScript thread; other platforms and worker threads receive
explicit errors. Application code imports no internal Solo packages.

## Opening a URL

`openExternalUrl(url: string)` accepts absolute HTTP/HTTPS URLs with a host and
an explicit `://` separator. Relative paths, other schemes, embedded credentials,
raw whitespace/control characters, and backslashes are rejected before dispatch.
Encode spaces in paths as `%20`. Unicode hosts/paths are normalized using URL
parsing; query strings and fragments remain URL data.

The native bridge validates independently of TypeScript. It passes an `NSURL`
to `NSWorkspace.openURL`, never to a shell. macOS chooses the configured browser.
Success means the OS accepted the request, not that the browser loaded the page
or that the destination is trustworthy. Applications still decide which links
to open and when to ask their users.

## Writing text

`writeClipboardText(text: string)` replaces the system clipboard with plain
Unicode text, including empty strings and multiline text. It uses the same
AppKit pasteboard as GPUI's existing copy/paste implementation, but checks the
write result instead of discarding failures. Existing selection-copy shortcuts
are unchanged. Clipboard reading and rich clipboard formats are not exposed.

A rejected pasteboard write throws; macOS may already have cleared the previous
clipboard contents when that happens. Do not assume clipboard writes are
transactional or that other applications cannot replace the contents afterward.

## Verification

Rust tests cover URL parsing and a real private-pasteboard Unicode round trip
without touching the user's clipboard. Public API tests check argument types,
unchanged text delivery, and error propagation. The packaged regression checks
that an invalid URL reaches a catchable error and leaves the app responsive.

After building native and core, build the standalone macOS fixture:

```sh
bun packages/solid/src/__tests__/fixtures/package-commands.ts desktop
```

Set `TMPDIR` to an existing external-disk directory to put its temporary bundle
and compilation output there. The script prints the executable path.

In the fixture's **Desktop** menu, choose **Open test URL** and confirm the
configured browser opens `https://example.com/#solo-desktop-check`. Choose
**Copy Unicode URL**, then paste into a new document in another application;
expect `https://example.com/世界?q=İstanbul#solo-desktop-check`. This manual copy
replaces the system clipboard. **Reject invalid URL** must show an error without
opening another application.
