# macOS menu-bar applications

Pass `menuBar` to `render()` to keep the application and its JavaScript work
alive after the last window closes. Without this option, Solo retains its
existing behavior and exits when the last window closes.

```tsx
import { render } from "@solo/solid"

const application = render(() => <App />, {
  title: "Newsprint",
  menuBar: {
    // Resolve this inside the packaged application. Relative paths are rejected.
    iconPath: "/Applications/Newsprint.app/Contents/Resources/menu-bar.png",
    tooltip: "Newsprint",
  },
})
```

The image is treated as an AppKit template image, so a monochrome asset adapts
to light and dark menu bars. The status-item menu contains `Open <title>` and
`Quit <title>` actions. Open activates the existing window or creates exactly
one replacement; Quit terminates the native event loop and JavaScript process.

Use `configureMenuBar` inside the mounted Solid owner to prepend reactive,
application-defined controls and update the icon or tooltip at runtime:

```tsx
import { configureMenuBar } from "@solo/solid"

function App() {
  configureMenuBar(() => ({
    iconPath: refreshing() ? refreshingIcon : idleIcon,
    tooltip: error() ?? "Newsprint",
    items: [
      {
        id: "refresh",
        label: refreshing() ? "Refreshing…" : "Refresh now",
        enabled: !refreshing(),
        run: refresh,
      },
      { type: "separator" },
      { type: "status", label: `Last refresh: ${lastRefresh()}` },
    ],
  }))
  return <Newsprint />
}
```

Action items support native disabled and checked states. Status items are
non-actionable text. Solo keeps its built-in Open and Quit entries after the
custom items. When the owning component unmounts, it drops the callbacks and
restores the original icon, tooltip, and default menu.

The render root exposes the same lifecycle controls for application UI:

```ts
application.closeWindow()
application.showWindow()
application.quitApplication()
```

The same root exposes the standard macOS zoomed state separately from
fullscreen:

```ts
application.maximizeWindow()
application.isWindowMaximized() // reads AppKit's live state
application.restoreWindow()
application.toggleWindowMaximized()
```

These methods use `NSWindow`'s native zoom operation, so restoring returns to
the frame macOS saved before maximizing. A change made with the green window
button is visible through `isWindowMaximized()` as well.

## State across reopening

Solo keeps the Solid owner, signals, timers, registered application commands,
retained element tree, and system-appearance subscription alive while no window
exists. Mutations continue updating that retained tree and the reopened window
paints its latest state.

A reopened window is a new native GPUI window. Window-local state therefore
resets: native focus, scroll handles, transient pointer state, and native child
views such as `WKWebView` instances are recreated. Applications that need to
restore focus or scroll position should keep those values in Solid state.

This capability is macOS-only. It keeps the process alive after window close;
it does not survive explicit Quit and does not provide launch-at-login behavior.
